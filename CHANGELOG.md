# Changelog

## 1.3.3-hotfix - 2026-07-26

### Changed

- Removed the obsolete `omni_provider_max_queued_items` and
  `omni_provider_send_operations` server options. Adaptive dispatch no longer has a
  configured material-window cap; fair remainder draining uses an internal high-throughput
  limit.
- Converted the complete dispatch work-unit accounting path to `long` and changed
  `omni_dispatch_max_work_units` to a long-valued option with a default of
  `2100000000` and a maximum of `Long.MAX_VALUE`.

### Fixed

- Reacquired render buffers after every render-type switch in the Omni
  Computation Core and separated multiblock projection model/outline passes,
  preventing `BufferBuilder: Not building!` client crashes.
- Replaced output-return-driven adaptive dispatch with complete-input acceptance
  feedback, so slow, high-parallel and output-less processing targets no longer
  stall material delivery while waiting for products.
- Repeated standard provider attempts safely within the same server tick. Every
  attempt remains one complete AE2 recipe with independent extraction and
  accounting; rejection or provider-side queuing stops the current tick and
  contracts the dispatch window.
- Removed the exact `PatternProviderLogic` class requirement from the standard
  adaptive path. Third-party providers that correctly implement AE2's
  `ICraftingProvider` success, rejection and busy-state contract can now use the
  same bounded high-throughput dispatch.
- Added full-amount preflight checks and cache-aware initial windows for standard
  AE2 pattern providers, while preserving the existing direct-batch path for
  explicitly compatible machines.

### Compatibility

- Existing worlds, patterns and configuration files remain compatible.
- The stable mod ID remains `molecularmanipulator`.
- Dedicated batch-provider and machine whitelist behavior is unchanged.

## 1.3.3 - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Made missing-material crafting summaries use the `ICraftingPlan` result from
  the same calculation, preventing unstable missing-item lists when external
  storage providers report different results during confirmation-page probes.
- Preserved extension data attached to AE2 crafting-plan summaries, fixing
  confirmation packet encoding with AE2: Crafting Tree installed.
- Removed completed-plan caching, in-flight calculation sharing and cancellation
  shielding from the Omni Computation Core so every request owns an independent,
  cancellable AE2 calculation.
- Restored AE2's native per-calculation inventory snapshot path instead of
  replacing it with an additional Omni snapshot context.
- Restored AE2's cooperative crafting-calculation pause handshake and added
  pause checkpoints inside Omni MAX_FAST compilation and execution, preventing
  live crafting-provider updates from racing long-running plan calculations.
- Saturated AE2WTLib restock-overlay inventory totals before they overflow and
  displayed the infinite sentinel as ∞, preventing wireless-terminal restock
  overlays from crashing on infinite network inventories.
- Accelerated actual crafting dispatch by extracting one recipe first and then
  deriving the safe batch size directly from available inputs and power, avoiding
  repeated whole-pattern searches when intermediate materials are still missing.
- Added bounded high-throughput dispatch for AE2 and ExtendedAE processing
  providers. A standard provider now starts with one queue-bounded probe and uses
  primary-output timing to select 16x, 4x, 2x or unchanged window growth; congestion,
  rejection and interrupted jobs contract the window. Explicit batch providers retain
  their direct long-limit path, and unsupported recipes retain the original path.
- Persisted each queued batch's one-craft ingredient vector and reseed every
  ingredient before bulk draining on every provider send tick. This prevents
  one-tick machines from leaving the first remaining material free to monopolize
  shared input slots after consuming the previous tick's reservation.
- Preserved single-recipe execution when batch expansion is unavailable or rolls
  back, while keeping the explicit provider whitelist.
- Replaced the Omni-Computation Core's unbounded same-tick dispatch with an
  adaptive work-unit scheduler. Virtual CPU lanes share fair per-tick quotas,
  batch-safe pushes retain unlimited logical craft counts, and all controllers
  share a configurable server-wide emergency deadline.
- Renamed client and server configuration files to the OmniSequence Transfinite
  name, with non-overwriting migration for global, default and per-save configs.

### Changed

- Removed the obsolete material-calculation cache-hit statistic from the Omni
  Computation Core interface.

## 1.3.2 - 2026-07-25

### Changed

- Replaced Quantum Entangled Singularities in OmniSequence recipes with ME
  Quantum Rings.
- Replaced the Quartz Cluster in the Computation Crystal Pylon recipe with a
  256k ME Storage Component.

### Fixed

- Infinite amounts now use source-specific compatibility for AE2 creative cells
  and ExtendedAE infinity cells.
- Removed network-wide simulated extraction probes so storage buses and external
  storage providers retain their native amounts without inventory refresh stalls.
- Displayed exact `Long.MAX_VALUE` storage amounts as `Infinite` instead of `9.2E`
  in AE2 terminals and storage tooltips.

## 1.3.1 - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Fixed an Omni Computation Core formation crash by respecting AE2's 16-thread
  per-block limit while preserving transfinite cluster-level parallelism.
- Displayed transfinite crafting storage and parallelism as `Infinite` in AE2's
  crafting CPU list and tooltip instead of abbreviated integer limits.
- Fixed shutdown stalls while unloading quantum-linked multiblocks by avoiding
  block updates and redundant AE2 grid work after their chunks begin unloading.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-07-25

### Highlights

- Renamed the project to **OmniSequence: Transfinite** while retaining the
  `molecularmanipulator` mod ID for world and configuration compatibility.
- Added the Omni Computation Core multiblock with transfinite crafting storage,
  long-range logical parallelism and controlled AE2 crafting calculation acceleration.
- Added quantum-linked AE networking and pre-formation construction access for both
  major multiblock structures.
- Extended AE2 crafting requests and supported infinite item sources to long values.
- Added safe MAX_FAST demand aggregation, duplicate subtree merging, batch topology
  calculation and compatibility fallbacks for substitution, container and dynamic patterns.
- Fluid-only substitution patterns remain eligible for deterministic MAX_FAST calculation
  and long-value batch dispatch; item substitution retains the conservative safety fallback.
- Added completion-feedback adaptive material dispatch: windows grow after full primary-output return and contract on provider congestion, rejection or interrupted jobs.
- Added original black-purple crystal models, textures, effects and redesigned machine UIs.
- Added one-click multiblock dismantling, player-facing placement and hostile-spawn suppression
  around the Omni Computation Core.

### Compatibility

- Minecraft 1.21.1
- NeoForge 21.1.230 or later
- Applied Energistics 2 19.2.17 or later
- ExtendedAE 1.21-2.2.32-neoforge or later
- Advanced AE 1.6.11 or later is optional
- ExtendedAE Plus and JEI integrations are optional

### Notes

- Existing worlds continue to use the stable `molecularmanipulator` namespace.
- Extremely large crafting requests remain subject to recipe-specific compatibility fallbacks.
